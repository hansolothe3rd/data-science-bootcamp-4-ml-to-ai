## Day 32 – Feature Engineering Deep Dive
**Focus:** Handling outliers, skewness, transformations, and scaling features.

**Mini Project:**  
- Dataset: California Housing  
- Steps:
  1. Detect and cap outliers (IQR method)  
  2. Fix skewed features (log transformation)  
  3. Scale numeric columns (StandardScaler)  
  4. Encode categorical features (one-hot)  
  5. Build preprocessing pipeline  
  6. Train Linear Regression and Random Forest models  
  7. Evaluate and visualize feature importances

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Clean, well-transformed features improve model performance  
- Scaling helps optimization  
- Pipelines make preprocessing reproducible
